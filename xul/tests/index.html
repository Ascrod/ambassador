      Welcome to the Mozilla IRC client tests page.  If you are generally 
      impatient, you can jump right to 
      <a href="#samples">the sample clients</a>, if not, read on.

      <center>
	<table border="1" bgcolor="lightgrey">
	  <tr>
	    <th>
	      File
	    </th>
	    <th>
	      Status (blank is bad<a href="#security">*</a>)
	    </th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Component binary (libbs.so, or bs.dll)
	    </td>	
	    <td>
	      <script language="javascript">
		if (Components.classes["component://misc/bs/connection"])
		  document.write ("OK");
		else
                  document.write ("Missing");
	      </script>
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Type Library (bs.xpt)
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      <script language="javascript">
		if (Components.interfaces.bsIConnection)
	          document.write ("OK");
		else
		  document.write ("Missing");
	      </script>
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </center>

    <p>
      If either of the files in the table above are not properly installed,
      the IRC client
      will not be able to create a a socket connection, and will be mostly
      useless.  The shared object
      is called libbs.so on Unix, and bs.dll on Windows (It is not yet 
      available on Mac), the interface definition is called bs.xpt, and is
      the same file on all platforms.  Both of these files should be located
      in your MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME/components directory.  Everything else
      related to the IRC client is either JavaScript, XUL, or HTML, and
      therefore is platform independant.
    <p>
      <a name="security"></a>
      Currently, the security code which prevents unsigned scripts from 
      doing Bad Things is incomplete.  If the status boxes above are blank,
      this is most likely the cause.  In order to work around this limitation,
      you must edit your <b>all.js</b> file, changing line:
      <pre>
pref("security.checkxpconnect", true);
      </pre>
      To read:
      <pre>
pref("security.checkxpconnect", false);
      </pre>
      This will disable the security code so that the IRC client can create
      the XPCOM component it needs.
    <p>
      <a name="samples">
      <hr>
      <h2>Sample clients...</h2>
      <br>
      <button onclick="loadClient(3)">test3.xul</button>
      is very 
      close to what I expect
      the final client to be.  At least, I expect not to throw out too much of
      this code.  The UI, on the otherhand, is potentially disposable.  
      <a href="./">irc/tests/</a>test3.css holds the styles
      for the UI, while <a href="./">irc/tests/</a>test3-output-default.css 
      defines the default style of the output window.  test3 displays usage
      info when it starts up, also /help can be used to display all possible
      commands.
    <h3>DISCLAIMER: test clients 1 and 2 have bitrotted, and may not work
       "out of the box"</h3>
    <p>
      <button onclick="loadClient(2)">test2.html</button> is
      (you guessed it) the second
      client.  The messages in the output window can be styled by tweaking
      <a href="./">irc/tests/</a>test2.css.  The views window
      controls what network or channel
      you are currently viewing.  There is NO DEFAULT, after joining a channel
      you must click on its entry in the views list before you see any output.
      The basic commands are:
      <pre>
/network linuxnet
/connect
/nick <your-nick>
/join #mozillazine
    </pre>
    <p>
      <button onclick="loadClient(1)">test1.html</button> is
      the 
      first client.  It has no
      CSS, and all input is displayed in the same window.  If you experience
      stability problems with the other clients, try this one.
      Commands are the same as in test2.html
