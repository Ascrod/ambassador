    <h1>IRC Test Clients</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the Mozilla IRC client tests page.  From here you
      can select a sample client to try out.  It appears that you
      <b>
        <script language="javascript">
          if (Components.classes["component://misc/bs/connection"])
            document.write ("do");
          else
            document.write ("do not");
        </script>
      </b>
      have the shared object properly installed, and you 
      <b>
        <script language="javascript">
          if (Components.interfaces.bsIConnection)
            document.write ("do");
          else
            document.write ("do not");
        </script>
      </b>
      have the interface definition properly installed.
    <p>
      If either of these files are not properly installed, the IRC client
      will not be able to create a a socket connection, and will be mostly
      useless.  The shared object
      is called libbs.so on Unix, and bs.dll on Windows (It is not yet 
      available on Mac), the interface definition is called bs.xpt, and is
      the same file on all platforms.  Both of these files should be located
      in your MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME/components directory.  Everything else
      related to the IRC client is either JavaScript, XUL, or HTML, and
      therefore is platform independant.
    <p>
      <button onclick="loadClient(3)">test3.xul</button>
      is very 
      close to what I expect
      the final client to be.  At least, I expect not to throw out too much of
      this code.  The UI is open for discussion.  
      <a href="./">irc/tests/</a>test3.css holds the styles
      for this one.  test3 displays usage info when it starts up, and
      /help can be used to display all possible commands.
    <p>
      <button onclick="loadClient(2)">test2.html</button> is
      (you guessed it) the second
      client.  The messages in the output window can be styled by tweaking
      <a href="./">irc/tests/</a>test2.css.  The views window
      controls what network or channel
      you are currently viewing.  There is NO DEFAULT, after joining a channel
      you must click on its entry in the views list before you see any output.
      The basic commands are:
      <pre>
/network linuxnet
/connect
/nick <your-nick>
/join #mozillazine
    </pre>
    <p>
      <button onclick="loadClient(1)">test1.html</button> is
      the 
      first client.  It has no
      CSS, and all input is displayed in the same window.  If you experience
      stability problems with the other clients, try this one.
      Commands are the same as in test2.html
    <p>
