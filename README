# Ambassador

Ambassador is a fork of the ChatZilla IRC client built upon the [Unified XUL Platform](https://github.com/moonchildproductions/uxp). It features a simple, straighforward interface with a number of options for customization and extensibility. It is available as an add-on compatible with other applications built upon UXP, and as a stand-alone package that can be installed and run independently of a browser.

## Platform Support

The add-on is compatible with the following UXP-based applications:
- [Pale Moon](http://www.palemoon.org/)
- [Basilisk](http://basilisk-browser.org/)

The stand-alone version can be downloaded in the following formats:
- Windows 64-bit installer
- Windows 64-bit ZIP archive
- Windows 32-bit installer
- Windows 32-bit ZIP archive
- Linux 64-bit tarball

MacOS is not supported at this time. If you would like to contribute to Ambassador development on MacOS, please contact me.
