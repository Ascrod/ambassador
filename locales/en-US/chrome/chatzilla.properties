### Note for localizers ###
#
# ChatZilla uses cmd.<command name>.* to construct the command's help, 
# parameters and any UI labels. For the command to continue to function, the
# *.params entries MUST NOT BE CHANGED. Hopefully in the future you will be
# able to localize these items as well.
#
### DO NOT LOCALIZE THE *.params STRINGS ###

pref.usermode.help              = Your usermode determins how the IRC server treats you (it is a list of letters preceeded by "+") - for example, you can get the server to send to message about "behind the scenes"-like things but setting a different usermode. The most common option, "i", makes you not show up as a member of a channel unless the user making the query is already in the channel (it stands for "invisible").

# These are the prefs that get grouped
# Localizers should make sure each version has the same string, and that they
